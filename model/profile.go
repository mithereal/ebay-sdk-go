	// <br/><br/>
	// This value is at the seller's discretion. Generally, it should be the same price or lower than the <b>shippingServiceCost</b> value.

	// This value is at the seller's discretion. Generally, it should be the same price or lower than the <b>shippingServiceCost</b> value. The seller may consider specifying a lower price to ship additional items as an incentive to the buyer to purchase multiple items.
